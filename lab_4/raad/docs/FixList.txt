For each bug, please provide the following information:
  - location
  - what was fixed
  - amount of time it took

Example:
Defect 0:
  Location: getWidth(): line 261
  Fix: wrong return value, should be width not height
  Time: 5 minutes

Defect 1:
  Location: equals(): line 88
  Fix: Unnecessary semicolon, removed it
  Time: 4 minutes

Defect 2:
  Location: equals(): line 94
  Fix: for loops i <= height caused index out of bounds, so changed it to i < height
  Time: 9 minutes
Defect 3:
  Location: equals(): line 95
  Fix: for loops i <= width caused index out of bounds, so changed it to i < width
  Time: 1 minute
Defect 4:
  Location: getElem(): line 246
  Fix: return matrix[i][j] was wrong, fixed it to return matrix [i-1][j-1]
  Time: 13 minutes
Defect 5:
  Location: setElem(): line 258
  Fix: matrix[i][j] = v; was wrong, fixed it to matrix[i-1][j-1] = v;
  Time: 3 minutes
Defect 6:
  Location: negate(): line 116
  Fix: matrix[i][j] = -matrix[j][i]; was wrong, fixed it to matrix[i][j] = -matrix[i][j];
  Time: 3 minutes
Defect 7:
  Location: multiplyWithScalar(): line 165
  Fix: for (int j = 0; i < width; j++) was wrong, fixed it to: for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)
  Time: 4 minutes





ANALYSIS:

1. Compute how long it took you to complete all the bug fixes and the average time per bug fix.

Total time: 37 minutes
Number of bugs: 7
Average time per bug fix: 5 minutes 28 seconds

2. What was the hardest bug you fixed and what made it hard to fix?
I think the negate() one was the hardest bug to fix, because I just could not think of whats wrong with that, because thats too small bug and its really hard to look for something like that.


3. How consistent was your time to fix each bug? What factors may have affected that consistency?
It was pretty consistent at first but then I was confused, whats all the yellow sign means in Intelli Je, like field matrix may be final, though its not a bug or an error, but these kind of things bothered me a lot. Rather than this, fixing the test cases was not that bad.
