Refactorings:
=============

0. EXAMPLE:  
   File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.jaba, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Identified: Common code to check if move will result in 
                    energy use and decrement energyLevel if that 
                    is the case
   Description of fix:  Push the common code into TimBot.java, creating a
                        protected method to be used instead.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

1. File: AngryBot.java
   Location: getNextMove(), approx. line 41
   Issue Identified: Inefficient score calculation for movement.
   Description of fix: Refactor score calculation into a separate method for better readability and potential optimization.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

2. File: ChickenBot.java
   Location: getNextMove method, approx. line 25
   Issue Identified: The original getNextMove method was complex and challenging to read, with embedded logic for calculating move scores and selecting a move.
   Description of fix: Refactored the method into smaller, more focused methods for improved readability. Introduced constants (SCORE_FOR_BOT and SCORE_FOR_ADJACENT_BOT) for clarity and ease of modification. Added an early return condition for situations where the bot has no energy to move. Streamlined the score calculation logic and isolated the energy deduction to the final move selection for accuracy.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

3. File: TimSim.java
   Location: main method, approx. line 1
   Issue Identified: The main method was overly long and complex, mixing different levels of abstraction and handling multiple tasks.
   Description of fix: Refactor the method by breaking it into smaller methods, each responsible for specific tasks such as loading configuration, instantiating bots, adding bots to the planet, and running the simulation rounds. This improves readability and makes the code more maintainable. Also suggested improved error handling and streamlined the simulation loop.
   Implemented: No
