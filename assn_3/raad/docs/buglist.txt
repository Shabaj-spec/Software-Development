BUGS FOUND AND FIXED BY UNIT TEST (should be 4-5 more bugs to find):

Bug 0:
  Class: FriendRecommender
	Method: makeRecommendations()
	Line: 27
	Cause: incorrect comparison
	Fix: ???

Bug 1:
  Class: User
	Method: find()
	Line: 41
	Cause: Incorrect string literal "nm" used instead of the variable nm
	Fix: Change return users.get( "nm" ); to return users.get(nm);

Bug 2:
  Class: User
	Method: isFriend()
	Line: 88
	Cause: Logical negation causing the method to return the opposite of the expected result
	Fix: return !adj.containsKey( u.name ); to return adj.containsKey(u.name);

Bug 3:
  Class: User
	Method: leave()
	Line: 79
	Cause: Incorrectly removing all users from the static users HashMap
	Fix: Remove the line users.remove(v.name); to prevent removing all users when one user leaves

Bug 4:
  Class: User
	Method: Constructor
	Line: Added a line
	Cause: The constructor does not check if a user with the same name already exists in the users HashMap before adding a new user.
	Fix: Added a conditional check to ensure that a new user is only added if they do not already exist in the users HashMap.

Bug 5:
  Class: User
    Method: unfriend()
    Line: 69
    Cause: The method does not correctly remove the current user from the other user's adj list.
